### <font color="gray">What is an organization</font>

An organization is the common space where admins can manage their employees, communicate important updates and keep track of their activity.

### <font color="gray">Admins</font>

Admins have management roles in all the features used by their employees in the User Application, through the Admin Application.
* They organize teams and locations;
* Prepare templates for reports and permits;
* Send important updates;
* Track working hours;
* Organize the Onboarding Induction & Health sections for their employees.

The Admin List is displayed in the navigation menu at tap on the "Admins" button.

### <font color="gray">Super Admins</font>

A Super Admin is a singular role in the Admin Application. Therefore, the Super Admin controls the access the other admins have in the application. They invite regular admins in the organization and dismiss them from the "Admins" button in the navigation menu. The Admin List displays a Delete option for each admin in the list, an action that is available only for the Super Admin.
