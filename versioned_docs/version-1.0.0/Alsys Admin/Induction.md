### <font color="gray">Set up Induction</font>

Whether the admin wants to create a General or a Specific Induction, the process is similar.

1. Tap on Induction tab in the navigation drawer in Admin Application.

import ind1 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/alsys_admin_playbook_menu_cards/static/img/ind1.png';

<img src={ind1} alt="ind1" />

 2. Tap on the "+" button in the top right corner to add a new Induction.

import ind2 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/alsys_admin_playbook_menu_cards/static/img/ind2.png';

<img src={ind2} alt="ind2" />

 3. Switch between General and Specific Induction.

import ind3 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/alsys_admin_playbook_menu_cards/static/img/ind3.png';

<img src={ind3} alt="ind3" />

 4. Fill in all the information required and tap on "Save".

 5. Choose the location in the dropdown or the entire list of users.

 6. The induction will be sent to all the users from a specific location (for specific induction) and to all existing users in the organization (for general induction).

import ind4 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/alsys_admin_playbook_menu_cards/static/img/ind4.png';
