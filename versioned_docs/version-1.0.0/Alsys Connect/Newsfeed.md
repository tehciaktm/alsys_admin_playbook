### <font color="gray">Newsfeed post categories: Toolbox Talks, RAMS, Training</font>

Newsfeed posts are distributed, depending on their content, in these three categories which can be found on the Home screen in the User Application. 
The structure of the posts is the same, only the content differs based on what files and information admins attach to them. 

import newsf1 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/alsys_admin_playbook_menu_cards/static/img/newsf1.png';

<font color="gray">How to confirm a post?</font>

1. Post confirmation requires reviewing all the files attached. The most important file attached is the one displayed under the title and has the “Open document” button on it.

2. When all the attachments were reviewed, the “Confirm” button will become active.

3. After making sure all the documents were reviewed, the user can tap on the active “Confirm” button.

4. If the admin set a questionnaire for the post, it will be displayed after tapping on confirmation button.

import newsf2 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/alsys_admin_playbook_menu_cards/static/img/newsf2.png';

<img src={newsf2} alt="newsf2" width="700"/>

After submitting the post, it will be displayed in the Confirmed section:

import newsf3 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/alsys_admin_playbook_menu_cards/static/img/newsf3.png';

<img src={newsf3} alt="newsf3" width="700"/>
