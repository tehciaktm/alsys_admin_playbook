Building trust with the organization enrolled.

1. The admin can invite members to the organization by adding their:

* Access Group
* Group (company, subsidiary, etc.)
* Schedule
* Trade

2. To join the organization, as a user you will need to provide:

* An email and account password
* Personal details.

import kyc0 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/git_playbook/static/img/kyc0.png';

<img src={kyc0} alt="kyc0" width="800"/>



3. If the user did not receive an invitation and still proceeds with the registration, he will be asked to contact the organization to receive a link to continue with the onboarding.

import company from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/github_projects/git_playbook/static/img/company.png';

<img src={company} alt="company" width="800"/>
